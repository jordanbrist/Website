          I exported this with a bitrate for Youtube specifically but it still doesn't look great. However, Vimeo apparently only allows users to post 2 videos each month without paying for a subscription so YouTube it is!
        </p>
        <p>
          For this render I changed the motion interpolation on only the animation of the character rig to "stepped" for one frame which essentially holds the animation inbetween frames rather than transitioning between them on its own.
          The movement of the character's position/location in 3D space, along with the movement of the camera, is still moving linearly at 24fps. It could still use some further tweaking and exploration , but it is finally looking the way I'd
          originally hoped. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After I go over it a bit more and finalize an approach for the movement/framerate I'll move on to the next step. That would be creating the rest of the sets (at least in a temporary capacity like this one) and setting up the camera 
          and character movement so that they follow their intended paths. Then I can continue on the character animation. Right now I am using a walk cycle from Mixamo. I am planning on using some other animations from Mixamo as well, but will
          need to refine them and then do some hand animating for pretty much everything other than walking.

        <h3>FPS Testing</h3>
        <h5>10-18-2023</span></h5>

        <br>
        <p>I have spent the last couple of days trying out some different options for frame-rate. I started with 24 FPS and, of course, it looks too smooth. I then tried interpolating the position of each keyframe by two steps to make it choppier, but in actuallity it just ended up looking jittery.
          However, I did like the look of the animation moving at a different rate than the camera, which was still moving at 24 FPS. I tried scaling down the keyframes of the animation and then scaling them back up, which helped reduce the keyframe count, but the animation is still interpolating 
          the positions of the rig on each frame which creates a smoothing effect. This current video is of a render in which I changed the render settings to animate everything at 12 FPS. I am currently rendering another pass of this test animation in which I change the frame interpolation to "stepped" 
          only for the character so that it looks as though it is moving at a slower rate than the camera, but I made sure this time to keep the object motion as a linear path so that it won't move jerk forward on every second frame. This could mean that the animation will be moving slower than the 
          movement of the character which would make things look strange/uncanny. If that ends up being the case then I will have to try it again and just increase the number of loops in the animation keyframes to match.

              YouTube's compression and bitrate makes things appear fuzzier than they should. Vimeo looks much better and closer to the actual rendered sequence. Apparently it could be due to the codec I chose when I exported.
            </p>
            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/875037028?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;quality_selector=1&amp;progress_bar=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen;" title="Render and Compositing Test 01"></iframe><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

            <p>I have changed my render engine, tweaked some settings, and then did some compositing on top of the rendered images. It is my first time doing any compositing in Blender so it took some time
                to figure out what exactly I needed to do but the node based editors aren't too different from Unreal Engine or TouchDesigner so it was a fairly straightforward process.
            </p>
            <p>
                I added some film grain and scratches, a faint glow from light reflections, some lens distortion and a light jitter to mimic gate weave. At present, the film grain is too heavy and the gate weave is almost imperceptable. 
                I think that with some minor adjustments and materials that mimic realistic textures things should begin to look the way I want. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As it stands, I am planning on animating each frame one-by-one (or two-by-two in this case for 12fps) to make the finished project look like stop-motion, but I will probably try out some add-ons or tricks to fake it or at least reduce the number of frames I'll need to animate by hand.

            <p>Over the course of this week I have refined the head sculpt, started some different attempts for the clothing (with and without cloth simulations), and tried out Blender's "hair curves" system of creating
                hair (not a fan of how it turned out, didn't look enough like it was the head of a puppet, more like real hair than I wanted, I'm going to try again using a community-made add-on). The character models will not be my main focus at this time, but I will be designing the rest of the characters soon.
            </p>
            <p>Following all of that I realized that I should focus my efforts on the parts that are more important: rigging, set design, camera lens size and aperture (to capture the right look of a miniature set), and other details that will help sell the look of real objects.
                I also had to go through all of my render settings and set everything up so that things run more efficiently on my computer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These pictures are from two cameras that I set up in the first mock-up of the first scene of my animation. Right now everything is just made from simple planes and cubes so that I can have a better understanding of the space I'll be working in. Once I have settled on scale and placement that feels "right" I will move on to the next scene and so forth until they are all set up properly.
                Once that is done I will begin modeling the sets with greater detail, using reference from screengrabs of Rankin-Bass films and other animated works by animator Tadahito Mochinaga.

            <p>This is the first iteration of the storyboard for this currently untitled animated work. 
                It is a rough guideline for me to use to keep track of camera angles, shot composition, movement, and also to give me an idea of what I will need to make models for.</p>
              <p>
                After I made this I went ahead and wrote out a quick (9 page) short story in my journal that follows the beats of the storyboard and expands upon them to give me a greater idea of the emotions of the characters and details of the environment.
