                In this exercise, we took an animation of a character moving his hand to a cup and bringing it up to his mouth and made the geometry of the cup follow his hand as he picked it up using parent constraints. 
                By constraing the object at the frame in which it is picked up and then changing the value to zero on the keyframe before, the object will stay in place and then move with the parent once it reaches the desired frame. 
                Another way of accomplishing this is to create a copy of the object, parent it to the character, and toggle the visibility of both objects on the frame where it is interacted with. 
                The static object is visible until it reaches the interaction frame, and then the parented object becomes visible.

                In order to scale all of the contents of a rig without deformation of the geometry, skeleton, etc; 
                The best way is to create something simple such as a nurbs circle and then parenting all of the necessary contents (except for the geometry) to it. 
                If the geometry is also added then it will not scale at the same rate as the skeleton. 
                Now, when scaling or moving the nurbs circle, it will also affect all of the parented objects.

                In this exercise, the pose editor was used to make a bicep "flex" and look less deformed when in a bent position. 
                Essentially, the geometry is edited during one frame and the pose editor allows the object to morph between the two instances as it approaches that keyframe. 
                So, when the arm is straight it is normal and when bent it has the large gaps filled. 
                Using the pose editor, it is possible to change the geometry of an object in frames where it is necessary. 
                By using the pose editor rather than adjusting the geometry on the fly, it is then possible to return the geometry to its original shape when not in a specific pose.

                This exercise focused on using the Offset Parent Matrices from earlier in the course, this time in conjunction with a node in the Node Editor called pickMatrix. 
                By running the matrix through a pickMatrix node, it allows for the separation of object transformation from the matrix. 
                For instance, the Offset Parent Matrix lets the surfboard's translation, rotation, and scale alter that of the character that is being parented. 
                By using the pickMatrix node and then deselecting "Use Scale" the surfboard can be scaled independently of the character. 
                Another topic discussed in this video was the use of constraints which, in prior versions of Maya, was a more common way of parenting an object to another. 
                By using a parent constraint, the transformation nodes of the child are unable to be edited as they are being controlled by the parent. 
                However, using matrices, this is no longer an issue. The character can move completely independently from the parented surfboard without altering the surfboard or the matrix.

                The focus on this exercise was using driven keys and blend shapes to dilate the pupil of an eyeball. 
                Using a slider with driven keys causing the Y translation of the slider to blend the geometry as it moves from -1 to 1. 
                At -1, the geometry is set to the narrow eye model, at 0 it is the regular eye model, and at 1 it becomes the dilated eye model. 
                The blend shape allows the geometry to shift seemlessly between sizes and the driven keys make the change happen based on the location of the slider.

                This exercise focused on the way eyes move when a character is turning their head. 
                When a person turns their head to look at something, their eyes will move slightly before the head. 
                Following the previous exercise, the change in eye direction was combined with a blinking animation. 
                When a character's head moves from side to side, it is also more lively/dynamic to add a sense of weight to the movement and the body by dipping the head down slightly during the arc of the head movement.

                In this exercise, we learned about the nuances of changing a characters eye direction. 
                Along with moving the eyes, subtle head movements and blinks are necessary to keep the character from feeling static or conveying an unintended emotion. 
                Using the information from the previous exercise "Animating Blinks" I decided to take it one step further and also animate movement of the eyebrows.

                In this exercise we learned about animating blinks (of course). 
                The instructor went over the details of blinking in animation and how it is used with movement, mood, and making a character feel like a living being. 
                Blinking alone is not enough to make a character look "alive". 
                For this exercise, the head and eyebrows were moved in conjunction with the blinking animation, which makes the character look less like a terrifying doll.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the sequence of 3 blinks, the first includes the movement of the head and eyebrows while the second and third are merely the movement of the eyelids.
                Seeing the two types of blink side-by-side really shows how the subtle movements create a more dynamic animation in contrast to the eyelids just moving up and down.

                By constraining an object to another using the rivet command, you can add an object to a scene that is already animated with a very short process. 
                In the exercise, we riveted a hat model to a point on the mesh of a character that is walking and jumping. 
                The hat stays in place with the geometry without deforming.

                Proximity wrapping is used when conforming a mesh to another. 
                In this exercise, we used a low resolution arm mesh with animation attached to it and proximity wrapped a higher resolution mesh (and a bracelet) to it. 
                By doing this, one can animate a lower resolution mesh and cut down on processing power due to the reduced number of vertices. 
                Then, when nearing the end of the project, a more detailed and high resolution mesh can be proximity wrapped and be used for the final render.

            Using proximity pins is one way to parent an object to a deformable mesh so that it can move along with the deformed surface. In this exercise, we pinned a

            By setting bookmarks for portions of animations along the animation timeline, it becomes easier to find animated movements for duplication and editing.
            You can also zoom in on a specific bookmark to see only the transformations taking place in that portion of the timeline. This is great for organization
            and saving time later on when animating in chunks.

            Using Offset Parent Matrices, you can change the position and orientation of an object without affecting its original location in space. 
		    This allows things to be animated more efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
		    Using the Script Editor in combination with the Node Editor, we created a simple script that automates a portion of the Offset Parent Matrices workflow for
		    quick and repeatable use.

		        Using the Node Editor, we created a node structure that parented the visibility of each mouth asset to a specific point of movement along the X-axis
		        of a sliding piece of geometry. This effect is great for animating stop-motion mouths.

              One thing that I wish I had done during the intro course was take some screen-recordings of the progress. I have notes but they feel kind of boring on their own. 
            So, for this course I have been taking screenshots and recordings of the end-product for each exercise.</p>
            <p>
                Having said that, the following entries will be quick breakdowns of each exercise along with a recording or screenshot of the work.

                I finally started the 3D Animation and Rigging course. It is split up into small sections like the previous course but it feels like a much more enjoyable experience
                so far. There were some elements of Maya that I found hard to acclimate to but with these smaller, more focused examples the content seems easier to grasp. 
                I do think that I would be having trouble had I not started with the Intro and learned the basics of the software prior to this. One last thing: 
                I enjoy 3D modeling but, for some reason, doing it in Maya feels like a chore, perhaps that is because it is mainly what I have been doing in Blender for my studio project. 
                Either way, doing the actual animation work and just forgetting about the modeling feels kind of relaxing.

            I decided to use this week as a review week. I started fresh in a new scene and modeled this car after I saw a picture of a similar one that someone made in Blender. I used many techniques from the 2024 Essential Training course and tried to spend more time getting familiar with the materials and the different settings for them.
            It certainly isn't perfect but I think that it went rather well considering I have only just learned the basics of the software. I am thinking about adding a spinning sphere underneath the car with terrain and a road on it and then animating it and the wheels so that they revolve around the Y Axis and then turn the exported image sequence into a looping gif.
          </p>

            I haven't had enough time to start my next Maya course yet, but I have decided that the next one I will be starting is "3D Animation and Rigging" on LinkedIn Learning. It is taught by the same instructor from the previous course I finished and it looks very promising. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/3d-animation-and-rigging/create-rigging-and-animation-with-maya">Here is a link.</a>

            <p>Tonight I finished the Maya 2024 Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning. It was a very good introduction to Maya and I definitely feel more comfortable using the software than before. The course consisted of 11 chapters and touched on the majority of the basic tools, menus, and techniques
             for modeling and making simple animations.
            </p>
            <p>I am planning on using my notes and doing a writeup of everything the chapters went through and things that I find are implemented in a way that I feel is better or worse than in Blender. The course videos were brief with the majority of them being less than
              or equal to five minutes. I found myself needing to go back and re-watch the videos as I was following along with the project files. 
            </p>
            <p>I thought that the use of the project files throughout the course was useful yet also could have been done better. For instance, I would say that the best way to 
              get someone to learn a program, especially one as dense with features as Maya, is to get them to iterate on top of the same project until it incorporates everything in each/every chapter. I am planning on doing this myself by making my own version of the course project from start to finish, 
              rather than using one tool and then changing to the next file as was done in the course. Doing this would allow me to get further acquainted with Maya and have something to show that is actually my own work rather than a bunch of premade files in which I have only contributed with minor adjustments.
