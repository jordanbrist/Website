            I read some people's opinions online regarding using Linkedin Learning courses to learn new things and I
            found a pretty great analogy that I thought I should share. I am paraphrasing a bit due to the comment being
            poorly structured but it was basically this: "LinkedIn Learning isn't great for everything and many courses
            can be extremely un-rewarding or even unsatisfactory for learning a subject. When in-depth knowledge is
            needed, LinkedIn Learning has the attention span of a TikTok; it is so short and high level that someone new
            to the subject might get something out of it but it won't prep you for real life scenarios." 
            <br>
            <br>
            I think
            that I would have to agree with this as a whole. However, as someone that gets easily distracted, these shorter
            bites of content feel easier to digest and also allow me to take more time on the individual tools that I
            would normally gloss over. Then, after each topic, I sit and write down what I learned so that I can better
            retain that information for later use. Basically, I can take each of these less than 10 minute videos and
            turn it into an experience that spans almost 30 minutes or longer.

            Quick Rig is a simple tool that allows you to create a skinned and controllable rig in a super short amount
            of time. It still has some areas that need to be refined but the whole process takes less time than even
            automated programs built purely for this task like AccuRig or Mixamo. I am blown away by this tool and yet
            again see another reason to make the switch to Maya for rigging and animation of characters.

            By creating a line of points snapped to the surface of the geometry of this head, we created a sweep mesh
            that is often used in the creation of stylized hair geometry. There are many different attributes that can
            be modified to create a specific look. This seems like a great and simple way to make stylized hair for a
            character model. It only takes a few clicks to set up a single strand and can be repeated over the entire
            scalp.

            Using both constraints and the node editor, we parented the body controller to a point that is always
            equidistant from the two feet of the character. This allows the feet to be moved without distorting the

            Continuing from the previous exercise, we took our muscle and made it deform the skin as it moves, grows,
            jiggles, etc. To do this, essentially all that needs to be done is some weight painting on the skin surface.
            Then it moves along with the movement of the muscle underneath. It feels like it should be more complex, but
            I also realize that this is the work of only a single muscle instead of a fully finished muscle structure.

            Maya's Muscle System is something that I am very excited to learn more about. In this exercise we simply
            used a pre-skinned arm skeleton and added a bicep to the rig. Then we set up the position, scale, and other
            things like jiggle. This seems like a very long and complex process for an entire body, but I'm sure it is
            worth it once it is all done

            By enabling the Sprink Solver IK attribute, you can access a different way of moving object chains with IK.
            The green joints are using a standard IK solver and they lift off the ground and shrink in a way that may
            not always be right for every situation. With the Spring Solver, the blue joints move in a more even and
            predicatable manner, like a spring. This seems like it will be very useful for more mechanical purposes
            where a standard IK is more fitting for organic movement.

            I don't think that the Component Editor is something that I want to use because it looks so daunting and
            complex. It is basically a table of values that belong to individual selected vertexes. I'm sure that it can
            be a useful tool to know and use but my brain is about to explode looking at even this small table of
            vertices.

            The Solidify Deformer keeps geometry from being stretched or deformed. In this example, this character has a
            belt buckle that is part of the character's geometry. Normally this would make it very difficult to change
            the way it behaves when the rest of the model is stretching. However, by creating a component tag
            encapsulating the vertices of the belt buckle and adding the Solidify Deformer onto it, now it no longer
            stretches with the rest of the model. It retains its shape and moves with the surface. This seems like a
            very useful tool that I could see myself using a lot.

            The Morph Deformer allows you to morph the geometry of a shape with another (kind of like blend spaces but
            for different use cases). In this exercise, we took a plain face and a duplicate of that geometry that had
            been altered and used the Morph Deformer to blend the geometry. The cool thing about this tool is that you
            can keep the original object intact while changing the features of the other object. This could be a good
            way to go about changing a character's emotion on the fly without too much trouble. I may have to play with
            this some more...</p>

            Using Component tags, you can take selections of vertices, edges, or faces and create groups called
            components. Then, in the attribute editor, you can select the component and it will select the group of
            vertices/faces/edges to be edited as if they were selected using the selection tool. This seems like a very
            useful tool and would save a lot of time in the modeling stage when working on a multi-faceted object with
            many intricate details.

            Yet another very quick demonstration. This time on the Move Skinned Joint Tool. This tool allows for the
            movement of a joint in an already skinned rig. Normally, if you were to move a joint in a skinned model, the
            skin will move with it and it will just deform the model. However, with this tool active, skinning is
            disabled and joints can be moved freely. Then, when you are finished with the tool, skinning is re-enabled
            and everything is back to normal with the exception of the new joint placement having taken effect.</p>

            Using the Redirect tool, you can change the rotation or translation of an object without messing up the
            animation. So, using the previous robot walk cycle, we added a redirect under the foot and set keyframes on
            the Y rotation and rotated it slightly. This is a very cool technique. I am surprised that it was so easy to
            use and love the fact that it doesn't change any of the underlying animation. I am sure that this same
            effect could be achieved using animation layers, but this seems quicker and even less invasive than
            animation layers.

            With the Time Editor, one can import an already existing animation clip and manipulate animations like you
            would video tracks in editing software.
            With this tool, we imported a walk cycle, found a spot where the run cycle timeline closely matched the spot
            on the walk timeline, and lined it up so that the character could transition from one animation to the next.
            This tool was kind of difficult for me to use, I kept going back and restarting from the beginning because
            it was difficult to line up the animation just right and felt kind of awkward to use in this manner.

            In Bonus Tools, there is a tool called Pattern Rename.
            This tool can be used to easily go through and rename objects in a scene without causing any errors to
            occur.
            You can search for a word and type in the replacement or add prefixes to selected objects.
            It isn't a super complex tool but it will probably be useful to know about.

            Namespaces are a simple and quick way to change the names of selected objects and unify them under a common
            name.
            For example, in the tutorial, all of the geometry and bones for a character model were added to a namespace
            called MaleChar.
            This then added "MaleChar:" in front of all desired objects. Namespaces can also be kept on import or export
            of a model.
            This basically is just a way to organize the objects in your scene so you don't get confused.
            If there is a way to do this in Blender I'd like to know how to do it...

            In this exercise, we learned how to create an aim control for an object (a character's head) by using an aim
            constraint.
            However, when using an aim constraint, you can no longer aim the head at something other than the aim
            controller.
            To get around this limitation, we simply made a new group and changed its center to the same point as the
            head controller.
            Then we added the aim constraint to the group instead of the control itself.
            By doing this, it allows the head to be controlled freely using the head controller or aimed using the head
            aim controller.

            Skin weights can be imported and exported from one file to another.
            The bone names must be the same and the characters must be UV mapped but this is another way to save a lot
            of time when it comes to weight painting multiple characters.
            This is something that I will certainly need to use again in Maya if I use it for any character rigging
            work.
            It's strange, I strongly prefer the UI and workflow of Blender when I am modeling or sculpting yet, I think
            that Maya is so much better and more intuitive for character rigging and and animation.
            Perhaps I should try to utilize them both so that I can spend less time trying and more time doing.

            When you have a character that is already weight-painted, rather than go through the whole process again,
            you can use a tool in Maya called Copy Skin Weights.
            This will only work if the skeletons and models are similar, but it will save time either way.
            Basically, just scale one of the meshes so that they are roughly the same size, overlap them in the editor,
            and click Copy Skin Weights and Maya will automatically apply the weight painting to the new rig.

            Just as in the previous exercise, we are focusing on cartoon eyes.
            For this, we specifically went and created quick rigging controls for the eye and its components.
            Using an aim constraint, the target control can direct the pupil direction.
            Using cluster deform and parenting each cluster of lattice vertices to the individual corner and squish
            controls we can change the shape of the eye.
            And, by using Set Driven Key, we can use a slider to change the rotation of the eyelid.
            This could also be done in the node editor but, for something this quick, set driven key will work just
            fine.

            This was just a very quick demonstration of how one can use the node editor in place of constraints when
            parenting a joint to a control (in this instance, a circle control).
            I'm surprised that this is such a simple task and even more surprised that it wasn't shown earlier in the
            course and then used for things like ribbon rigging.
            Rather than parenting using a parent constraint, all you have to do is open the node editor with both items
            selected and drag the rotation and scale nodes from the parent to the child object.
            For translation, the only extra step that needs to be taken is to go into the object's attribute editor and
            copy the translation values to the Transform Offset Parent Matrix before resetting the transform attributes
            to zero and linking the nodes in the node editor.
            I don't know too much about the work that happens behind-the-scenes with parent constraints, but I do know
            that earlier in this course we learned that it was better to use Offset Parent Matrices and the Node Editor.
            This is really just a more concise re-iteration of that point.

          <h3>Section 7 - 4: Controlling Stretch with Tension</h3>

            The Tension deformer is similar to Delta Mush in that it is used to smooth the distortion of vertices.
            However, Delta Mush is mainly used when squashing an object (like with the creasing of the leg and pelvis in
            the previous exercise), whereas Tension is best utilized in the stretching of a mesh.
            So, with this outstretched arm, the geometry starts to buldge a bit and become distorted as the shoulder is
            rotated. With Tension, that evens out the distance between the vertices and smooths out the whole thing,
            making it look much better.
            However, this also then caused there to be some distortion on the opposite side of the shoulder where
            vertices were bunched close together.
            Rather than painting the area to keep it from deforming, all that was needed to fix the problem was to
            reduce the Squash Constraint from 1 to 0.
            This will allow that shoulder to utilize the tension deformation when it stretches in the oposite direction
            as well.

            Delta Mush is a deformer that is used to, in this scenario, smooth out creases in a mesh without needing to
            use weight painting (which most people consider to be a long and annoying process).
            While it can be applied to the whole mesh, it is better to use it on an isolated area.
            In this exercise, we used the used the painting tool to turn the Delta Mush that was applied to the entire
            mesh and reduce the strenght to zero, effectively nullifying it.
            Then, I painted along the crease in the mesh where the leg hits the pelvis to smooth out the area and remove
            the unsightly crease.
            This is a pretty interesting tool and I think that it will be very useful when working with
            un-weight-painted meshes.

          <p>
            This wasn't really an exercise so much as an introduction and overview of Maya's HumanIK tool.
            Having done a little bit of hand blender and mostly utilizing auto-rigging add-ons or things like ActorCore
            AccuRig and Mixamo to have the process mostly automated for me, I have a bit of an idea of how awful it is
            to rig characters in the vanilla Blender software.
            With that being said, Maya having this HumanIK BUILT IN TO THE SOFTWARE is pretty freaking cool.
            I still can't quite believe just how in-depth it is as well. I am blown away by the thought of using this in
            the future and seeing just how much it improves my workflow.
            Even the small things are very interesting. For instance, there is the ability to add extra effectors to
            joints to create extra points of rotation; in the example video it was used at the fingertips to make the
            wrist pivot at the fingers instead of at the wrist joint.
            There are also buttons that change the IK from moving just the selected joint, to a whole body part, to the
            entire body. Then there is also the option to pin the translation and rotation of selected portions of the
            rig to keep that part of the body stationary.
            The last thing that was discussed was the Aux Effector. Essentially this is a small box created at a
            specific joint that can keep it in place in a point in space while still allowing for movement and weight to
            push against that part of the body.

          <p>
            As the title states, this was pretty quick. We animated a wagging dog tail.
            The tail is made up of three joints and as the base of the tail moves, the ones further down follow.
            All that was required to move the tail was to rotate the base of the tail by 20 degrees, the middle by 25,
            and the tip by 30. Made some start and end keyframes.
            Then using another handy dandy DASH EQUATION (mentioned in the last post) we multipled the value of each
            rotation by negative 1 to get the inverse position.
            Added another keyframe and we were met with a somewhat convincible wagging animation. However, it was still
            to rigid and blocky.
            To make the animation more fluid and make the weight of the tail appear as if it was moving like a real tail
            that follows the laws of physics, we went into the graph editor and moved the keyframes for the middle
            segment by two and the end segment by 4.
            This slight delay in the rotation of each joint allows the tail to move in a much more realistic way.

            For this exercise, we started with a robot with a walk animation. The animation is composed of a single step
            with each foot.
            From there, we went into the animation graph editor and created a walk cycle by cycling the animation to
            infinity.
            Following this, we added the animation to an animation layer and then, on a separate layer, animated a
            translation on the Z axis for the moving components.
            To make the movement follow the proper speed of the walk cycle, we did something that I had never previously
            been taught or learned anywhere.
            It's this: look at the start position of one foot and then use the distance from that to the end position.
            After that, double it (one for each leg) and that is the proper value to add to each component to make it
            move at a constant rate that matches the animation.
            It is extremely simple, yet somehow never occured to me. I usually just try and eyeball it until it looks
            right so from now on I will be using this as a guideline for walk cycles.
            Ok, tangent aside, the movement was still kind of "slide-y" and the way to fix this is pretty common in all
            animation (I even use it for blender), in the graph editor, I just had to select the Z translation for each
            component and change the interpolation to linear.
            This removes any smoothing between frames and makes things move as they are meant to. Then it was just a
            matter of cycling the movement with the walk cycle and PRESTO! it moves.</p>
          <p>
            One little aspect of this lesson that I found super helpful was learning how to use a function to add the
            same integer to each item's position without screwing everything up or having to do any math.
            For example, if we are translating each piece of the robot by 11 for each cycle of 25 frames, we can just
            select all of the geometry and type (in the specific value in the channel box) +=11 and it will add 11 to
            each of the existing integers that correspond with that item. </p>

            First, I must say this: animation layers are amazing. In this exercise, we looked at how animation layers
            work and how to add to them in order to animate different parts of an animation on separate layers.
            This is something that is EXTREMELY useful when working with all of the subtle changes in character
            animation. Specifically, for this animation, we started with a character sitting in a pool that is looking
            around. Aside from the head turn and facial animation, the body of the character was static.
            From there, we added the selected animation to a new animation layer, locked it, and created a new layer. In
            the new animation layer we added a light bobbing motion to make the character look like it is floating in
            the water.
            Then, we added the foot IK controllers to that same animation layer and animated the feet movement both up
            and down and out to the sides to make his feet look like they are dangling in the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to take this one step further and add some animation to the characters arms. Rather than keeping
            them at his sides, I figured he looked more like a character that would have them extended above the water
            (kind of like a child) His arms were a bit high, so I lowered him further into the water and added some
            subtle rotation to his shoulders to keep his arms mostly above the water as he bobs up and down.

            This was a quick wrap-up on ribbon rigs. We just used Bind Skin to constrain the geometry to the the ribbon
            rig.
            Now, the movement and rotaion of the rig and joints will also deform the skin of the model as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to this, I had never had any experience with ribbon rigs. Now I think I have a little bit better
            understanding of what they do and how to make them in Maya.

            To start, a quick adjustment was made to the ribbon plane to make the elbow bend in a smoother way.
            To do this, all it took was adding two isoparms to either side of the segment in the middle of the elbow
            joint.
            Now it has a more gradual bend towards the center of the elbow. Following that, we duplicated the ribbon
            plane and added a blendshape modifier to them.
            Then, to the blendshape, we added a twist deformer to the geometry. Then, in the node editor, the x-axis
            rotation of the wrist IK was connected to the start of the twist.
            Now, when the IK handle is rotated, it deforms the ribbon rig and twists it with the rotation of the wrist.

            Created more joints (5 of them) and lined them up using the joint nodes from last exercise. Now there is a
            joint for the shoulder, bicep, elbow, forearm, and wrist. From there, we used Bonus Tools to create a circle
            control.
            Once that was all finished, the new joints were parented to the joints on the existing skeleton.
            Some were just regular parent constraints while the bicep and forearm were point constraints with a second
            aim constraint that makes them keep the same orientation as the joint above them.
            This makes it so the bicep orientation will follow the shoulder and the forearm follows the elbow. Now, the
            ribbon moves and flexes with the movement of the skeleton.
            This should then make it easier to move the geometry on top of it. But I haven't gotten that far yet so I'm
            not quite sure.

            In this exercise, we took an animation of a character moving his hand to a cup and bringing it up to his
            mouth and made the geometry of the cup follow his hand as he picked it up using parent constraints.
            By constraing the object at the frame in which it is picked up and then changing the value to zero on the
            keyframe before, the object will stay in place and then move with the parent once it reaches the desired
            frame.
            Another way of accomplishing this is to create a copy of the object, parent it to the character, and toggle
            the visibility of both objects on the frame where it is interacted with.
            The static object is visible until it reaches the interaction frame, and then the parented object becomes
            visible.

            In order to scale all of the contents of a rig without deformation of the geometry, skeleton, etc;
            The best way is to create something simple such as a nurbs circle and then parenting all of the necessary
            contents (except for the geometry) to it.
            If the geometry is also added then it will not scale at the same rate as the skeleton.
            Now, when scaling or moving the nurbs circle, it will also affect all of the parented objects.

            In this exercise, the pose editor was used to make a bicep "flex" and look less deformed when in a bent
            position.
            Essentially, the geometry is edited during one frame and the pose editor allows the object to morph between
            the two instances as it approaches that keyframe.
            So, when the arm is straight it is normal and when bent it has the large gaps filled.
            Using the pose editor, it is possible to change the geometry of an object in frames where it is necessary.
            By using the pose editor rather than adjusting the geometry on the fly, it is then possible to return the
            geometry to its original shape when not in a specific pose.

            This exercise focused on using the Offset Parent Matrices from earlier in the course, this time in
            conjunction with a node in the Node Editor called pickMatrix.
            By running the matrix through a pickMatrix node, it allows for the separation of object transformation from
            the matrix.
            For instance, the Offset Parent Matrix lets the surfboard's translation, rotation, and scale alter that of
            the character that is being parented.
            By using the pickMatrix node and then deselecting "Use Scale" the surfboard can be scaled independently of
            the character.
            Another topic discussed in this video was the use of constraints which, in prior versions of Maya, was a
            more common way of parenting an object to another.
            By using a parent constraint, the transformation nodes of the child are unable to be edited as they are
            being controlled by the parent.
            However, using matrices, this is no longer an issue. The character can move completely independently from
            the parented surfboard without altering the surfboard or the matrix.

            The focus on this exercise was using driven keys and blend shapes to dilate the pupil of an eyeball.
            Using a slider with driven keys causing the Y translation of the slider to blend the geometry as it moves
            from -1 to 1.
            At -1, the geometry is set to the narrow eye model, at 0 it is the regular eye model, and at 1 it becomes
            the dilated eye model.
            The blend shape allows the geometry to shift seemlessly between sizes and the driven keys make the change
            happen based on the location of the slider.

            This exercise focused on the way eyes move when a character is turning their head.
            When a person turns their head to look at something, their eyes will move slightly before the head.
            Following the previous exercise, the change in eye direction was combined with a blinking animation.
            When a character's head moves from side to side, it is also more lively/dynamic to add a sense of weight to
            the movement and the body by dipping the head down slightly during the arc of the head movement.

            In this exercise, we learned about the nuances of changing a characters eye direction.
            Along with moving the eyes, subtle head movements and blinks are necessary to keep the character from
            feeling static or conveying an unintended emotion.
            Using the information from the previous exercise "Animating Blinks" I decided to take it one step further
            and also animate movement of the eyebrows.

            In this exercise we learned about animating blinks (of course).
            The instructor went over the details of blinking in animation and how it is used with movement, mood, and
            making a character feel like a living being.
            Blinking alone is not enough to make a character look "alive".
            For this exercise, the head and eyebrows were moved in conjunction with the blinking animation, which makes
            the character look less like a terrifying doll.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the sequence of 3 blinks, the first includes the movement of the head and eyebrows while the second and
            third are merely the movement of the eyelids.
            Seeing the two types of blink side-by-side really shows how the subtle movements create a more dynamic
            animation in contrast to the eyelids just moving up and down.

            By constraining an object to another using the rivet command, you can add an object to a scene that is
            already animated with a very short process.
            In the exercise, we riveted a hat model to a point on the mesh of a character that is walking and jumping.
            The hat stays in place with the geometry without deforming.

            Proximity wrapping is used when conforming a mesh to another.
            In this exercise, we used a low resolution arm mesh with animation attached to it and proximity wrapped a
            higher resolution mesh (and a bracelet) to it.
            By doing this, one can animate a lower resolution mesh and cut down on processing power due to the reduced
            number of vertices.
            Then, when nearing the end of the project, a more detailed and high resolution mesh can be proximity wrapped
            and be used for the final render.

            Using proximity pins is one way to parent an object to a deformable mesh so that it can move along with the
            deformed surface. In this exercise, we pinned a
            soul patch to a character's chin so that it would move with the chin as the mouth and chin were deformed.

            By setting bookmarks for portions of animations along the animation timeline, it becomes easier to find
            animated movements for duplication and editing.
            You can also zoom in on a specific bookmark to see only the transformations taking place in that portion of
            the timeline. This is great for organization
            and saving time later on when animating in chunks.

            Using Offset Parent Matrices, you can change the position and orientation of an object without affecting its
            original location in space.
            This allows things to be animated more efficiently.

          <p>
            Using the Script Editor in combination with the Node Editor, we created a simple script that automates a

            quick and repeatable use.

            One thing that I wish I had done during the intro course was take some screen-recordings of the progress. I
            have notes but they feel kind of boring on their own.
            So, for this course I have been taking screenshots and recordings of the end-product for each exercise.</p>
          <p>
            Having said that, the following entries will be quick breakdowns of each exercise along with a recording or

            I finally started the 3D Animation and Rigging course. It is split up into small sections like the previous
            course but it feels like a much more enjoyable experience
            so far. There were some elements of Maya that I found hard to acclimate to but with these smaller, more
            focused examples the content seems easier to grasp.
            I do think that I would be having trouble had I not started with the Intro and learned the basics of the
            software prior to this. One last thing:
            I enjoy 3D modeling but, for some reason, doing it in Maya feels like a chore, perhaps that is because it is
            mainly what I have been doing in Blender for my studio project.
            Either way, doing the actual animation work and just forgetting about the modeling feels kind of relaxing.

            I decided to use this week as a review week. I started fresh in a new scene and modeled this car after I saw
            a picture of a similar one that someone made in Blender. I used many techniques from the 2024 Essential
            Training course and tried to spend more time getting familiar with the materials and the different settings
            for them.
            It certainly isn't perfect but I think that it went rather well considering I have only just learned the
            basics of the software. I am thinking about adding a spinning sphere underneath the car with terrain and a
            road on it and then animating it and the wheels so that they revolve around the Y Axis and then turn the
            exported image sequence into a looping gif.
          </p>
          <p>
            I haven't had enough time to start my next Maya course yet, but I have decided that the next one I will be
            starting is "3D Animation and Rigging" on LinkedIn Learning. It is taught by the same instructor from the
            previous course I finished and it looks very promising. <a

          <p>Tonight I finished the Maya 2024 Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning. It was a very good
            introduction to Maya and I definitely feel more comfortable using the software than before. The course
            consisted of 11 chapters and touched on the majority of the basic tools, menus, and techniques
            for modeling and making simple animations.
          </p>
          <p>I am planning on using my notes and doing a writeup of everything the chapters went through and things that
            I find are implemented in a way that I feel is better or worse than in Blender. The course videos were brief
            with the majority of them being less than
            or equal to five minutes. I found myself needing to go back and re-watch the videos as I was following along
            with the project files.
          </p>
          <p>I thought that the use of the project files throughout the course was useful yet also could have been done
            better. For instance, I would say that the best way to
            get someone to learn a program, especially one as dense with features as Maya, is to get them to iterate on
            top of the same project until it incorporates everything in each/every chapter. I am planning on doing this
            myself by making my own version of the course project from start to finish,
            rather than using one tool and then changing to the next file as was done in the course. Doing this would
            allow me to get further acquainted with Maya and have something to show that is actually my own work rather
            than a bunch of premade files in which I have only contributed with minor adjustments.
