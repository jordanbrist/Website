            <p>Over the span of this week I have refined the head sculpt, started some different attempts for the clothing (with and without cloth simulations), and tried out Blender's "hair curves" system of creating
                hair (not a fan of how it turned out, didn't look enough like it was the head of a puppet, more like real hair than I wanted, I'm going to try again using a community-made add-on). The character models will not be my main focus at this time, but I will be designing the rest of the characters soon.
            </p>
            <p>Following all of that I realized that I should focus my efforts on the parts that are more important: rigging, set design, camera lens size and aperture (to capture the right look of a miniature set), and other details that will help sell the look of real objects.
                I also had to go through all of my render settings and set everything up so that things run more efficiently on my computer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These pictures are from two cameras that I set up in the first mock-up of the first scene of my animation. Right now everything is just made from simple planes and cubes so that I can have a better understanding of the space I'll be working in. Once I have settled on scale and placement that feels "right" I will move on to the next scene and so forth until they are all set up properly.
                Once that is done I will begin modeling the sets with greater detail, using reference from screengrabs of Rankin-Bass films and other animated works by animator Tadahito Mochinaga.

            <p>This is the beginning stage of sculpting the head for the main character. It needs to be refined, smoothed, painted, and then I will move on to adding hair, eyebrows, pupils, and interchangable mouths.</p>

            <p>This is the basemesh I will be using for character models. I based it off of some pictures of Rankin-Bass stop motion puppets. The next thing to do with this will be to rig a skeleton to the mesh so it can be posed.</p>

            <p>This is the first iteration of the storyboard for this currently untitled animated work. 
                It is a rough guideline for me to use to keep track of camera angles, shot composition, movement, and also to give me an idea of what I will need to make models for.</p>
