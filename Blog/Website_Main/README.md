## Jordan Brist

1. Over the course of the semester, I have learned so much about web development (relative to my prior knowledge, at least). Using github to host webpages, instantly changing files using GitHub desktop, optimizing for both mobile and desktop, dropdown menus, and even divs were all new to me.
2. Prior to this course, I didn't know how to add custom fonts to webpages or how to utilize positioning to arrange things either in front of others or keep them static when scrolling. 
3. Making a webpage work correctly on mobile was so challenging. It took countless hours of trial and error but I learned a lot from it. I found out that if you open up the console in google chrome, you can resize the window and see exactly how many pixels wide the viewport is. I plan on utilizing this in the future for better optimization in different window sizes.
