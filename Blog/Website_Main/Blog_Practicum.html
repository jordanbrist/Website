            Since I haven't started my next Maya course after finishing the previous one, I used this week as a review week. I started fresh in a new scene and modeled this car after I saw a picture of a similar one that someone made in Blender. I used many techniques from the 2024 Essential Training course and tried to spend more time getting familiar with the materials and the different settings for them.
            It certainly isn't perfect but I think that it went rather well considering I have only just learned the basics of the software. I am thinking about adding a spinning sphere underneath the car with terrain and a road on it and then animating it and the wheels so that they revolve around the Y Axis and then turn the exported image sequence into a looping gif.
          </p>
          <p>
            I haven't had enough time to start my next Maya course yet, but I have decided that the next one I will be starting is "3D Animation and Rigging" on LinkedIn Learning. It is taught by the same instructor from the previous LinkedIn Learning course I finished and it looks very promising. Here is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/3d-animation-and-rigging/create-rigging-and-animation-with-maya">link.</a>

          <p>Tonight I finished the Maya 2024 Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning. It was a very good introduction to Maya and I definitely feel more comfortable using the software than before. The course consisted of 11 chapters and touched on the majority of the basic tools, menus, and techniques
             for modeling and making simple animations.
            </p>
            <p>I am planning on using my notes and doing a writeup of everything the chapters went through and things that I find are implemented in a way that I feel is better or worse than in Blender. The course videos were brief with the majority of them being less than
              or equal to five minutes. I found myself needing to go back and re-watch the videos as I was following along with the project files. I thought that the use of the project files throughout the course was useful yet also could have been done better. For instance, I would say that the best way to 
              get someone to learn a program, especially one as dense with features as Maya, is to get them to iterate on top of the same project until it incorporates everything in each/every chapter. I am planning on doing this myself by making my own version of the course project from start to finish, 
              rather than using one tool and then changing to the next file as was done in the course. Doing this would allow me to get further acquainted with Maya and have something to show that is actually my own work rather than a bunch of premade files in which I have only contributed with minor adjustments.
